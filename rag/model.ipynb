      "According to page 33, a PRIMARY KEY is a constraint in SQL that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is one of the most important concepts in database design.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Characteristics of PRIMARY KEY\n",
      "Based on page 33, a PRIMARY KEY:\n",
      "* Must be unique\n",
      "* Cannot be NULL\n",
      "* Is used to identify rows in a table\n",
      "* Can be a single column or a combination of columns\n",
      "* Each table can have only one primary key\n",
      "\n",
      "## Example of PRIMARY KEY\n",
      "As shown on pages 33 and 35, an example of a PRIMARY KEY is:\n",
      "```sql\n",
      "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
      "id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
      "name VARCHAR(100)\n",
      ");\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, the `id` column is the PRIMARY KEY, which uniquely identifies each row in the `users` table.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Takeaways\n",
      "According to page 35, the key takeaways for PRIMARY KEY are:\n",
      "* Use PRIMARY KEY for the main identifier of a row.\n",
      "* Use UNIQUE for enforcing non-duplicate values in other columns (like email or phone).\n",
      "* You can have only one primary key, but you can have many unique constraints.\n",
